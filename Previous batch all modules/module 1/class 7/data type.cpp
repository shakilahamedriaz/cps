** int data type
................

        int data type = 4 bytes = 32 bits
        1 byte = 8 bits

        32 bit represent 2^32, but for one sign bit it is 2^31
        32 th bit is used for sign bit  (sign bit is 0 for positive and 1 for negative)

        range of int data type is -2^31 to 2^31 -1
        range -2 * 10^9 to + 2 * 10^9

Now pracrise : additon, substraction, multiplication, division, integer_division (remove all fractional part);
