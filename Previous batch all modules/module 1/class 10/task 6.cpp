#** Decimal to binary conversion:
# suppose a decimal number is : 11
- now represent it to binary, then what will be the process?
- here is the process:

    = 11 % 2 = 1 ----> 1    lsb
    = 11 / 2 = 5
    = 5 % 2 = 1 ----> 1
    = 5 / 2 = 2
    = 2 % 2 = 0 ----> 0
    = 2 / 2 = 1 
    = 1 % 2 = 1  ----> 1     msb
  
    so, the binary number is 1011
