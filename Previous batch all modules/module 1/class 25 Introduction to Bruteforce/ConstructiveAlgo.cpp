// what is constructive algorithm?

// Constructive algorithm is a method used to solve a problem by building a solution piece by piece, adding one element at a time. It involves starting with an empty solution and incrementally adding elements to it until the desired solution is achieved. This approach is often used in optimization problems where the goal is to find the best solution based on certain criteria.
